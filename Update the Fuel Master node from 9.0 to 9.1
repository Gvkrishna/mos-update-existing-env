## Update the Fuel Master node from 9.0 to 9.1
Log in to the Fuel Master node CLI as root.

##  Verify that mos-update is available in the list of your repositories:
~~~~~~
cat /etc/yum.repos.d/mos-updates.repo
~~~~~
  ## If the mos-update repository is unavailable, run:
~~~~
    yum-config-manager --add-repo=http://mirror.fuel-infra.org/mos-repos/centos/mos9.0-centos7/updates/x86_64/
    rpm --import http://mirror.fuel-infra.org/mos-repos/centos/mos9.0-centos7/updates/RPM-GPG-KEY-mos9.0
~~~~~
  ##  Clean the YUM cache:
~~~~
    yum clean all
~~~~
  ##  Install a code-based integrity check tool Cudet. This tool also includes the necessary update commands for fuel2:
~~~~
    yum install python-cudet
~~~~~
  ##  Prepare the Fuel Master node for the Noop run:
~~~~
    update-prepare prepare master
~~~~~
     - This command installs new * fuel-nailgun * and * fuel-astute * packages on the Fuel Master node. Also, it executes Nailgun dbsync and restarts the astute and nailgun services.

  ##  Update the Fuel Master node packages, services, and configuration:
~~~
    update-prepare update master
~~~~
  ##  Warning

     - During the update procedure, the Fuel Master node services will be restarted automatically.
       The script calls yum update and then runs Puppet tasks to update the Fuel Master node.

    ## Verify whether you have the updated packages on the Fuel Master node:
~~~~
    rpm -qa | grep fuel
~~~~~
    - In the output, verify whether the Fuel packagesâ€™ names correspond to the ones presented in the Mirantis OpenStack 9.1 packages list.
      If you have a Mirantis OpenStack environment 9.0, proceed to Update an existing Mirantis OpenStack environment from 9.0 to 9.1.
